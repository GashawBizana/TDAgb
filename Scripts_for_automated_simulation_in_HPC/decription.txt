In this folder, you find scripts for submitting slurm jobs on a High Performace Computing clusters and running simulations in an automated fashion

The simulations that we are running here are Atomistic Simulation (Via LAMMPS) of Grain Boundary migration under two driving forces (Mechanical- $\tau$ and Jump in Chemical potential - $\Psi$)

The folder includes:

Bash scripts: needed to submit a slurm job
Two  python scripts (AJS_*): Python scripts to specify GBs, define simulation conditions and automatically submit jobs for multiple simulations
